    Thank you so much for patronizing my blog!
    I'm Bufan Zheng ( 郑卜凡 ). I completed my undergraduate studies at Wuhan University, and I am currently pursuing further education at the University of Tokyo, School of Science.
    My current research interests are in high energy theoretical physics (hep-th) and related mathematical physics. In addition to math and physics, I am also interested in computers and have learned a number of programming languages, and the creation of this website has been a process of learning the front end of the web.
    Let's dog-paddle in the sea of knowledge.
