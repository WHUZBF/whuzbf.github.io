# About My Blog

Thank you so much for patronizing my blog!

This blog is about physics, math and my life (if I have :joy:). From time to time, I will update here with some study notes or personal insights related to high energy physics and math. If you're interested in my rants, you can add this site to your Rss feed so you can keep track of what I'm up to.

Confucius said, "No one is a saint, no one is without fault." If you find any problems with my knowledge related (after all, everyone's life is not uniform, but there is only truth in science :grinning:) blogs or something you can't understand. Don't hesitate to send me an email!

I'm very sorry, but since I'm writing the notes for myself, they are generally written in my native language, Simplified Chinese. Maybe I'll consider writing in English or other languages later on!

This blog was created using jekyll, thanks to [zhujiajuan's blog](https://zjiajun.github.io/) for the inspiration!

# Acknowledge
