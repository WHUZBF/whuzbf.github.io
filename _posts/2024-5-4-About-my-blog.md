# About My Blog

Thank you so much for patronizing my blog!

This blog is about physics, math and my life (if I have :joy:). From time to time, I will update here with some study notes or personal insights related to high energy physics and math. If you're interested in my rants, you can add this site to your Rss feed so you can keep track of what I'm up to.

Confucius said, "No one is a saint, no one is without fault." If you find any problems with my knowledge related (after all, everyone's life is not uniform, but there is only truth in science :grinning:) blogs or something you can't understand. Don't hesitate to send me an email!

I'm very sorry, but since I'm writing the notes for myself, they are generally written in my native language, Simplified Chinese. Maybe I'll consider writing in English or other languages later on!

This blog was created using jekyll, thanks to [zhujiajuan's blog](https://zjiajun.github.io/) for the inspiration!

# ðŸ‘‰DisclaimerðŸ‘ˆ

I am just an ordinary young person passionate about theoretical physics, with rather mediocre academic and research abilities. My blog mainly serves as a record of my life and what I have learnedâ€”by no means should my notes be taken as absolute truth. Feel free to read them for funðŸ¤¡, and if you have any academic questions, we can discuss and improve together!ðŸ«µ

# Acknowledge

A special thanks to expe for contributing the knowledge overload of math and physics notes :+1:, and the beautiful illustrations to the site :+1::+1::+1::+1:.

# Some Bugs

## Translator
The translator will keep the selected target language for translation even if you view different pages on this site after choosing the target language. This can be quite convenient in some cases. However, some blog pages on this website are in English, and they may not require translation (after all, machine translation can sometimes cause unexpected errors). Therefore, I recommend that when you encounter obvious translation mistakes, first try switching to English to pause the translator and see if that helps.

## Formula Rendering:
With optimization, the website automatically adds a scrollbar for horizontal overflow when rendering formulas. However, Iâ€™m not sure why all formulas are being considered as vertically overflowing (although this doesnâ€™t happen in most cases), so I used the code `overflow-y: hidden`. This works in most cases, but in rare instances, vertical overflow does occur, causing formulas to be wrongly cropped, especially when encountering large summation or product symbols. Based on my tests, this bug is not critical. It will automatically disappear when the webpage is zoomed in, and I recommend that you (if you are using a regular laptop to view this blog) set your browser zoom to 110%-125% for the best reading experience.
